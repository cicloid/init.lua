# Init Config for NeoVim (init.lua)

I'm basically trying NeoVim, so I'm following along streamer ThePrimeagen to get
an initial Lua config for NeoVim.

I may start later importing all the settings I do miss from my old vim conf's
and convert those to Lua. But that may still take a while.

In the meantime. This may be considered highly experimental and prone to be scratched
at anytime, so you may want to just look at this at your own peril.
